CPAP:
  full: continuous positive airway pressure
  definition: A non-invasive ventilation mode that provides a constant steadypressure to keep the lungs expanded

Fi02:
  full: fraction of inspired oxygen
  definition: concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture that the patient inhales

IPPV:
  full: intermittent positive pressure ventilation
  definition: A mandatory invasive ventilation mode used to replacea patient’sbreathing when they cannot for themselves. Can be either volume controlled or pressure controlled. It does not synchronise any patient breathing efforts.

PRVC:
  full: pressure regulated volume controlled
  definition: A mode of ventilation where a set tidal volume is delivered to the patient while maintain the lowest pressure possible in the airway, to avtrauma.
