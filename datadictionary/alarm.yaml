# Note the following standard suffixes:
# diff - difference between desired and achieved values
# div - divergence between two measured values (ie sensor problem)
# hi - high
# low - low

## TODO: Alarm meta configuration
#Meta data for each alarm
#start-up (default) threshold
#maximum user settable value
#minimum user settable value
#criticality:
#mandatory on
#ideal on, but user may disable (leading to on-screen alert to user)
#optional - off by default, user may anable
