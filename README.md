# About Project VentOS

The VentOS project mission is:

> To create a free and open-source software library and embedded operating system
> to enable engineering teams to develop safe and effective invasive and
> non-invasive ventilators for diverse contexts.

The project aims to:

* support the [100's of global hardware
projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1inYw5H4RiL0AC_J9vPWzJxXCdlkMLPBRdPgEVKF8DZw/edit?usp=sharing)
that started when world health authorities projected a ventilator short-fall
* help the members of these teams see the most value from the software
engineering work already done within these projects

The project was initiated by [Dr Erich Schulz](https://twitter.com/ErichSchulz),
an Australian Anaesthetist together with
Dr Robert Read, PhD, of [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/).
They were rapidly joined by Ben Coombs, a New Zealand Engineer.

The core team is focused on producing high quality software products, starting
with simple, rapidly achievable modules before laying foundations for advanced
systems that will make modern ICU specialist knowledge accessible to
disadvantaged communities with over-run health care systems.

We could use your help! Please drop by the [#project-ventos channel in the Helpful Engineering slack](https://helpfulengineering.slack.com/archives/C016J0YEL7P)
and tell us a bit about yourself and how you'd like to help.

If you have been helping one of the many existing ventilator teams we'd especially love your support.

We have weekly team catch-ups via Zoom. Let us know if you'd like to attend.
